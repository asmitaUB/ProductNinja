Hi, This is Asmita, a Master's in Business Analytics, and an Aspiring PM !
Thank you for landing at my GIT , and showing interest in my profile

I am an impassioned aspiring product manager, having 4+ years of work experience in leading 3 cross-functional analytics teams building BI platforms and dashboards. Being a continuous learner throughout, I feel lucky to gain problem-solving and leadership skills, which are transferable to a product manager. I love being a jack of all trades, enjoy learning new technologies to continuously evolve myself and strive for excellence.
